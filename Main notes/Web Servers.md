# Apache 2 configuration
- In `/etc/bind` there's a *default named zones* file where you can specify config files for different domain names and IPs, and inside these config files (usually `db.DNS_DOMAIN_NAME`) you can specify details of that domain name, like its aliases, TTL, subdomains along with their IP address, etc. In the file `db.IP_ADDRESS` you can specify which domains have authority on other domains.
- In the `available-sites` directory, you can copy the default file and rename it, then edit it by setting `ServerName` to the name you want to use in the `host` http header to find the website, as well as setting `DocumentRoot` to the directory containing your website's files inside the `/var/www` directory.
- This way, by matching the ServerName and the domain name you can make it so the http request with that specific hostname is directed at the directory you specified. And to make multiple websites with different hostnames on a single IP address you can make multiple dns aliases to the main domain name (canonical name) and matching each one of them to a file in `available-sites`. Then `a2ensite SITE_NAME` to enable the website then reload apache (systemctl command).
