• To overcome urges, create physical obstacles like using blockers or moving your computer to a public area.  
• When an urge strikes, change your environment by going to a different room or outside.

• Try the 10-minute rule for motivation, doing something, anything, only for 10 minutes.

• "Urge-surfing", accept the urge, think of it as a passing desire that will go away and something you don't have to act upon.  
• To find motivation, start with small, low-effort activities to build momentum.  
• Connect with your deeper "why" or the reason you want to change your behavior.  
• Try the "act as if" method and do something even if you don't feel motivated.  
• Find a new hobby, and pair it with something you enjoy like listening a podcast.  
• Talk to someone, such as a friend, family member, or a professional, to address loneliness.  
• Be patient and forgiving with yourself when you experience setbacks.  
• If the problem is persistent, consider seeking professional help.
