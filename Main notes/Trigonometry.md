**Radians:** Full circle for radius (half-diameter) of 1 is equal to $2 * \pi$ in radians.

No matter how much the arc stretches, the radian's value stays the same. For example, let's assume a quarter of a circle is the current value, that would mean that the radian is $\pi/2$, no matter how big the diameter of the circle is. Of course, this is strictly the angle we're talking about, not the actual distance represented by the arc.

**Pythagorian trigonometric identity:** just as it sounds, it's the pythagorean identity applied to trigonometry. When you visualize a trigonometric circle, if you take any point on that circle, the lines leading to the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of that point form a triangle rectangle, meaning we can use the pythagorean theorem. Thus, we get (with 1 being the hypotenuse):
$$cos(\theta)^2 + sin(\theta)^2 = 1$$

**Sine and cosine graphs:** You take the value of either one (depending on which one you're studying) based on the coordinates of the point at any moment in time where the point is moving along the circle and map it to the $y$ axis, with the $x$ axis being the time variable. Another identity here is that $cos(\theta)=sin(\theta+\pi/2)$

**Special triangle:** When the angle is $\pi/4$, we have both $sin$ and $cos$ equal to the same number, so with a few steps we can deduce that:
$$a = 1/\sqrt{2}$$
( $'a'$ being the unknown value of sine theta and cosine theta). Using other properties of triangles, we can derive the other special triangles ($\pi/6$ , $\pi/3$ , etc ...)

Sum identities, double angle, power reduction and $sec , csc$, etc need to be looked up and worked on more.
