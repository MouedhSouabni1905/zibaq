- Encoding: Converting data from one form to the other for the purpose of storage or transmission. Data representation, not security.
- Hashing: Taking something that shouldn't be stored in plain text and converting it to another form, from which you can't decipher the original text. Converting data to an irreversible form using  a hashing algorithm. When authenticating, the password is hashed then compared with the password that's stored in hashed form. Hashing is 3 things, irreversible, deterministic (same input => same output), and fixed length.
- Encryption: also to protect information by transmitting it in a different form but this time it has to be two way to allow for communication. Whoever has the key to this encryption, can see the message.
