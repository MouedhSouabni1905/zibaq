# How to solve it
1. Understand the problem
>What is the unknown? The data? The condition?
2. Find the connection between the data and the unknown, consider auxiliary problems if no immediate connection is found, then devise a plan
>Try solving, removing or changing different parts of the problem
3. Carry out the plan
>Check at each step if it is correct, can you prove that it is correct?
4. Look back
>Can you check the result? Is there another way to get the result? Can the result or method be used/applied to another problem?

- Solving a problem means changing your point of view again and again, the solution could progress little by little from each point of view as you keep switching between them and finally be complete
- It is a very bad idea to start devising or carrying out a plan before fully understanding the problem, to avoid that you could for example try to state the problem fluently while pointing out the unknown, the data and the condition (all the while taking notes of any concepts you had difficulty understanding to review them later), try to draw a figure, introduce notations, etc
- When coming up with a plan remember similar problems, unknowns, data, conditions, etc and consider anything related to the current problem
- You should be honestly convinced of the correctness of each step
- Looking back, try to see what you did, the method etc, and how it can be applied or seen in different scenarios

### Why?
The point of doing this process for every problem you solve, is to train your mind to do these things reflexively. After you solve many problems this way, your brain will start using this process every time it is faced with a problem to solve. It will get used to associate past problems with the current one, making it easier for you to remember them. It will automatically consider the many questions and possibilities when analyzing the problem so you would be able to understand them better and faster. And it will think about future problems and how to use the current problem and its results in the context of other problems, helping you generalize and learn what you just did.
