## Ideas

- [ ] Neovim plugin that fully replaces my obsidian system to centralize it
- [ ] Lua plugin for templates/quickadd and querying
- [ ] A full program written in nix that reads nix files and outputs documentation based on a special syntax (mainly for describing packages that I have installed)
- [ ] A bash script that finds all includes in a folder of C files and prints a dependence tree
- [ ] Egyptian PL Statistics dashboard all in python and the web interface in flask
- [ ] Version Management System using Ruby, coupled with a key value storage server and client for online hosting of code (and if possible conflict management) and a web interface (in addition to using merkle trees)
- [ ] Nosql database in crystal and a modern modular configurable web server and infrastructure in crystal
- [ ] SIEM dashboard maker in rust
- [ ] A rust program that solves linear optimization problems
- [ ] Write my own language (with pointers)
- [ ] Small OS in my own language
- [ ] Theorem prover interpreter by resolution in haskell
- [ ] Reproducible NixOS web server (dns server, multiple hosts, etc)
- [ ] Python script that sends all images in homedir to my discord server and deletes them


## In development

- [ ] Goals app in C
- [ ] Ruby bookmarks app
- [ ] DNS and HTTPS server in PHP and then a pipeline for markdown to html converter written in php that converts my notes into a website


## Finished
