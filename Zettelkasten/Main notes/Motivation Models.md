**Herzberg's two factor theory:**
- Hygiene factors: job, food, good environment, comfortability
- Motivators: recognition, responsibility, personal growth
They overlap with Maslow's model but highlight the importance of the fact that removing dissatisfaction (satisfying hygiene factors) does not necessarily create motivation, that is done by motivating factors.

**Alderfer's ERG theory:**
- Existence, Relatedness then Growth
- Frustration-regression: if a person can't achieve a "higher" need it tries achieving a "lower" one more intensely

**Self-determination theory:**
- Autonomy
- Competence
- Relatedness
