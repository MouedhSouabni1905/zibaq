- The most important thing in this step is information gathering. Possible tools include BasKet Note Pads (for linux).
- Attention to detail: even the smallest clues can be big catalysts

##### Developing a relationship
**Communication:**
- It is the single most important part of this step
- Communication model: Source, channel, message, receiver, feedback
- The receiver's understanding of the message is usually influenced by his current emotional state and past experiences
- Planning process: What is the reaction you seek from the target? Gather information and know your target. Choose a channel of communication.
- Preloading: Preparing the target to receive information in a certain form and understand it in a certain way

##### Taking advantage of the relationship
- The construction of the phrase and demeanor can cause people to have some special behavior
- People tend to respond more to people who look stressed
- They also tend to talk more when praised
- Your goal is gaining primary information that you can then use to direct the target towards revealing more crucial information
- When talking, be natural (don't talk about what you haven't mastered), improve your knowledge, don't be too greedy, remember that a conversation is supposed to be a reciprocation as in giving and taking, work using your own set of competences and don't try to be someone contrary to your personal nature
- People only open up when *confidence* is established, don't act unnaturally (body gestures), offer help only when you have a real solution, listen to people and show interest
- Elicitation: https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/counterintelligence/elicitation-brochure.pdf
- Use smart questions: open-ended questions to learn more about the target or give him comfortable space, close-ended questions to lead him where you want, questions with a hint towards the answer, don't ask too many questions as that can close off the target, ask one question at a time, start with neutral questions to gather information about the target
- **Pretexting:** the background, facade, and personality you are trying to take the role of
- It is based on a lot of research, involving your own personal interests, simplistic, appear natural and spontaneous, has to provide the possibility of gathering the wanted information either through logical deduction or following the target
- Pretending to know a topic and failing at it destroys a relationship
- Cognitive dissonance: A contradiction between your beliefs and your actions which can cause a discomfort inside you, and the way a person handles it is by choosing one of the two sides which can sometimes lead to bad/unwanted decisions
- Don't think about how you feel, because that can affect your performance
